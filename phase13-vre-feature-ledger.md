# Phase 13 VRE Feature Ledger

This is the append-only VRE-side feature ledger for Phase 13 implementation
work.

Do not use this ledger as biomedical evidence. It records software governance,
edition isolation, runtime safety boundaries, validation evidence, and
adversarial review state only.

## T13.0.1 Wave 0 Tracking And Isolation Scaffold

who: Codex authored the Wave 0 default-off tracking and isolation scaffold
after Claude Code non-author HAT 1 ACCEPT.

when: 2026-06-18.

why: Phase 13 needs a tested edition boundary before any autonomous-scientist
layer can be built. The base VRE must not expose autonomous behavior by default,
and future runtime work must be traceable through Phase 13 ledgers, WIKI, count
invariants, and aggregate CI.

verification:

- RED: `node --test environment/tests/autonomous/isolation/autonomy-gate.test.js`
  failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` before `environment/autonomous/gate.js`
  existed.
- RED: `node --test environment/tests/ci/validate-edition-isolation.test.js
  environment/tests/ci/check-phase13-ledger.test.js` failed while both CI
  validators were absent.
- RED: `validate-counts.js` required repair because two non-test CI validators
  and one autonomous test family were added.
- GREEN verification is recorded in the HAT 3 handoff before non-author review.
- Supplemental N1/N2 hardening: the disabled Phase 13 error envelope now emits
  `runtimeOpened:false`, and edition-isolation has a negative import-boundary
  fixture for `E_PHASE13_BASE_IMPORTS_AUTONOMOUS`.

scope:

- Wave 0 opens only a default-off gate and edition-isolation enforcement.
- `environment/orchestrator/autonomy-runtime.js` remains the existing Phase 9
  unattended-objective runtime and is not duplicated under
  `environment/autonomous/**`.
- `capabilities --json` and the base task registry expose no autonomous command
  or autonomous task kind while the tier is off.
- no L0 reasoning loop, L1 skill orchestration runtime, L2 utilities, L4 swarm,
  L5 capstone, provider automation, GUI/clipboard relay, live Phase 12 run
  state, claim/export, publication/Graphify writeback, real-data read,
  biomedical claim, commit, or push is opened by this row.

Claude Code supplemental HAT 3 ACCEPT for the N1/N2 hardening delta is recorded
via

Codex authored this HAT 2 implementation and did not self-ACCEPT it. Commit and
push are authorized only for the scoped T13.0.1 patch after non-author HAT 3
ACCEPT.
